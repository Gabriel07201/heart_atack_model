# Heart Attack Prediction Analysis

This project aims to predict the occurrence of heart attacks based on various medical attributes. The dataset used for this analysis can be found on Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rashikrahmanpritom/heart-attack-analysis-prediction-dataset?select=heart.csv). 

The analysis begins with an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data and identify any patterns or trends. This includes visualizing the distribution of different attributes, identifying missing values, and calculating summary statistics.

Next, the data is split into training and testing sets, and feature scaling is applied to the data. A decision tree classifier and a random forest classifier are trained on the training data and their performance is evaluated on the test data using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

The best model is chosen based on the accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score

The Random Forest Classifier model has a higher recall rate and accuracy, which is important in this case.

The code also includes a visualization of the confusion matrix and uses cross-validation to check the model's performance on unseen data.

Note: The specific steps taken will depend on the problem you're trying to solve and the data you have available, so it's always a good idea to experiment and try different approaches.The Random Forest Classifier model has a higher recall rate and accuracy, which is important in this case.
